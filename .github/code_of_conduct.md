# contributor covenant code of conduct

## our pledge
in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## our standards
examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- using welcoming and inclusive language
- being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- focusing on what is best for the community
- showing empathy toward other community members

examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- the use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- public or private harassment
- publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## enforcement responsibilities
project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## reporting guidelines
if you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible by contacting the repository owner:

- github: [/moniburnejko](https://github.com/moniburnejko)
- email: [moniburnejko@gmail.com](mailto:monaburnejko@gmail.com)  

all reports will be handled with discretion. retaliation against anyone who reports an incident in good faith will not be tolerated.

## enforcement
instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers. the maintainers will review and investigate and may take any action they deem appropriate, including but not limited to:
- warning the offender
- temporary or permanent ban from the repository or organization
- removal of offending content or contributions
